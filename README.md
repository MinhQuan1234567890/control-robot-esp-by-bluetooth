# control-robot-esp-by-bluetooth

Controlling a robot car via bluetooth

**Progression:** First, plan out idea, test out on simulators to see if ideas work. Next, select (any usuable) components. After testing to see if components works, esemble the machine. after the hardware is finished, try out basic code to see if wires are mounted correctly, to see if motors are working correctly, etc... Afer which design app, and develop bluetooth code and control. After the software part is done, test on the robot, tweak any unforseen error, change the design sighyly to make it look more pleasing (it did't work after, returned back to design bafore). Project is completed.

**Component used:**
-2 breadbroads (1 regular size, 1 mini)
-Mica body for the robot
-2 motors, with a wheel for each one
-1 metal ball roller for better steering
-1 TTGO OLED 32 
-1 L293D
-1 power circuit
-2 18650 3.7 V batteries.
-a whole lot of wires and screws
-1 servo (ununsed for now, future expansion)
-1 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (ununsed for now, future expansion)
